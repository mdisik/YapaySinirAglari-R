Modified	National	Institute	of	Standards	and	Technology	(MNIST)	is	a	large database	of	handwritten	digits...

MNIST	has	a	sample	of	several	handwritten	digits

We	will	split	the	dataset	of	70,000	rows	into	60,000	training	rows	and 10,000	test	rows.	

we'll	find	the	accuracy	of	the	model

28x28	pixel	handwritten	digits containing	numbers	between	zero	and	nine.

At	this	point,	we	create	a	28x28	matrix	with	pixel	color	values	by	taking	the tenth	row	of	the	dataset

These	are	the	images	of	the	handwritten	digits	contained	in	the	first	six	rows	of the	dataset
